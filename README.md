# Sidebar Theme
I'm forking this gorgeous theme just to make it work in 2017. Although its design is timeless, the code is not. Last update is from 2013 and original author [Ricky Rauch](https://twitter.com/rickyrauch) recently joined forces with Scale API to help them with [new website, backend, brand and stuff](https://medium.com/@rickyrauch/im-joining-scale-3818945d8c49#.3uskz81zs). I am happy for the dude, but on the other hand I sad he is not into making themes anymore... SF will take everyone one day.
